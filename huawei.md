# Meng Wanzhou

## Claim
According to Crown counsel in Canadian court, Meng was "charged with conspiracy to defraud multiple international institutions."[27] The warrant was based on allegations that Wanzhou had cleared money that was claimed to be for Huawei, but was actually for Skycom,[28] an entity claimed to be entirely controlled by Huawei, which was said to be dealing with Iran, contrary to sanctions. According to the defense lawyer, the bank involved in the dealings was HSBC. The allegations were rejected by Meng's defense lawyer, who claimed she did not break any U.S. or Canadian laws.[29] The Crown counsel said that the case against Meng stemmed from a 2013 Reuters report about the company's close ties to Hong Kong-based Skycom Tech, which attempted to sell U.S. equipment to Iran, despite U.S. and European Union bans.[30]

Meng accused the U.S. of misrepresenting her case by omitting key information in the evidence filed against her. According to her legal team, the U.S. omitted slides No.6 and No.16 of the Powerpoint used as evidence against Meng, which show she was far more transparent to HSBC than suggested. The slides contain a statement that Huawei worked with Skycom in Iran and that they had normal and controllable business cooperation with each other. The new court filings contend that since HSBC was aware that Huawei and Skycom were operating in Iran, they would have known they could not process Skycom funds through U.S. banks without violating U.S. sanctions law. This would not have been an issue since HSBC could have used the Clearing House Automated Transfer System (CHATS) in Hong Kong for clearing Skycom transactions, which would not have involved risk of violating U.S. sanctions law.[84]
